        <h3>About myself:</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a first generation american for my family, a lot of my family comes from El Salvador. Arrving to the United State of America in the late 90's. I grew up playing soccer it was was a huge part of my life and escape from everything, a happy place. I learned so much from coaches and parents
            From what i have learned i apply in my everyday life, being punctual, respecting everyone equal, and alway give everything you do 110% never giving only a 50%. 
            I followed an education in automotive after high school and started a career in the automotive industry then moved onto becoming a diesel technician which i am currently still doing.
            Now im furthering my education in web development, programming , and coding. looking to learn more as i go on with my education in it.
